<p>One of the simplest forms of classification is the Rawlin and Thomas Classification which was devised in 19991. In this, Adverse Drug Reactions are divided into Type A, Type B and Others which include Type C, D and E. </p>

<p><b>Type A:</b> The reactions will usually be dose related. They are predictable, acute and related to mechanism of action. The risk factor of Type A is less than that of Type B.</p>

<p><b>Type B:</b> the reactions will be independent of the dose administered to the patient. It could be due to an allergy or hypersensitivity. They will be Idiosyncratic, unpredictable, acute/sub-acute. </p>

<p><b>Type C:</b> These reactions are due to chronic or continuous use of drugs.</p>

<p><b>Type D:</b> These reactions refer to carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. These reactions are delayed in onset and are very rare since extensive studies are done on the side effects of a drug before it is licensed. </p>

<p><b>Type E:</b> These reactions occur when a drug is stopped or if the dosage is reduced. This can include withdrawal reaction or second malignancies following successful chemotherapy.</p>
