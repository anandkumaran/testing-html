<p>The literature on compassion emphasises the relational nature of the concept (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Paulson DS (2004) Taking care of patients and caring for patients are not the same. <i>AORN Journal</i>. 79, 2, 365-366.">Paulson 2004</span>, <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Sabo BM (2006) Compassion fatigue and nursing work: can we accurately capture the consequences of caring work? <i>International Journal of Nursing Practice</i>. 12, 3, 136-142.">Sabo 2006</span>, <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Sanghavi DM (2006) What makes for a compassionate patient-caregiver relationship? <i>Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety</i>. 32, 5, 283-292.">Sanghavi 2006</span>) &ndash; compassion revolves around the way in which people relate to each other. It is not so much about what people choose to do for each other, but what they choose to do together. Therefore compassion implies a level of reciprocity and interdependence. Making explicit which dimensions of care comprise compassion is challenging because of the often invisible nature of this work. <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Pearson A (2006) Powerful caring. <i>Nursing Standard</i>. 20, 48, 20-22.">Pearson (2006)</span> referred to the invisibility of small acts of compassion as &lsquo;simple not clever; basic not exquisite; peripheral not central&rsquo;.</p>

</div></div>
<p>Such acts are thought to be important, but in reality may have little currency for those managing and developing services. These acts are often more noticeable by their absence. The invisibility surrounding the concept of compassion has significant implications for its recognition, promotion and assessment in practice.</p>

<h3 id="nav09"><b>Definition</b></h3>
<p><b>Compassion</b> has been defined as &lsquo;a deep awareness of the suffering of another coupled with a wish to relieve it&rsquo; (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Chochinov HM (2007) Dignity and the essence of medicine: the A, B, C, and D of dignity conserving care. <i>British Medical Journal</i>. 335, 7612, 184-187.">Chochinov 2007</span>) and &lsquo;a deep feeling of connectedness with the experience of human suffering that requires personal knowing of the suffering of others, evokes a moral response to the recognised suffering and that results in caring that brings comfort to the sufferer&rsquo; (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Peters MA (2006) Compassion: an investigation into the experience of nursing faculty. <i>International Journal for Human Caring</i>. 10, 3, 38-46.http://www.sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/3514914">Peters 2006</span>).</p>
</div></div>
<p>Not everyone would describe day-to-day acts of compassion as being preceded by noticing suffering. Suffering could be seen as a response to some sort of extreme crisis. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to view compassion as a response to <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="<b>Vulnerability:</b> the state of being susceptible to physical harm or emotional injury, or appearing as if you are.">vulnerability</span> in others, as this more accurately reflects compassion in practice (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Dewar B (2011) <i>Caring about Caring: An Appreciative Inquiry about Compassionate Relationship Centred Care</i>. tinyurl.com/cm5w2cz (Last accessed: April 8 2013.)">Dewar 2011</span>).</p>

<p>There is much debate about the term compassion and how compassion can best be supported, valued and assessed in practice. <span class="cite1001 greenText citeText" onclick="gotoCite(this,'to')" id="cite1001">Box 1</span> offers a definition of compassionate care. Some processes have been highlighted as enabling compassionate care, such as developing interpersonal skills and supporting people to connect emotionally with patients to form meaningful relationships (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Fosbinder D (1994) Patient perceptions of nursing care: an emerging theory of interpersonal competence.

<p>Compassionate care is a relational activity that is about &lsquo;the way in which we relate to other human beings when they are vulnerable. It can be nurtured and supported. It involves noticing another person&rsquo;s vulnerability, experiencing an emotional reaction to this, and acting in some way with the person, in a way that is meaningful for people. It is defined by the people who give and receive it, and therefore interpersonal processes that capture what it means to people, are an important element of its promotion&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="footnote">(Dewar <i>et al</i> 2011)</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<p>These dimensions and processes provide some insight into what is needed in practice to deliver compassionate care. However, there is more scope to examine the concept of compassion as it relates to all those involved, including self, patients and their families, and colleagues.</p>
