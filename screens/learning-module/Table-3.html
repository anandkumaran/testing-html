<ul>
<li>Maintain a consistent message of compassion across all activity in the organisation, for example using compassion as the foundation for all policies.</li>
<li>Develop organisational language that supports compassion, for example rather than talking about behaviours that are expected, talk about behaviours that individuals value and aspire to.</li>
<li>Develop guidance for good practice in communicating in a compassionate way, for example notices about visiting. Rather than writing in red and bold font saying that visiting is strictly between certain times and restricted to two people to a patient, this can be communicated in a way that conveys the preferred practice, but that invites people to discuss other options.</li>
