<h1 id="nav16">Conclusions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Compassionate care is a skilled interpersonal process that is important for staff, patients and families.</li>
<li>There is much knowledge about the things that are important to patients in relation to good caring, but less about what practices promote and support compassion in the workplace.</li>
<li>Knowing who people are and what matters to them, understanding how they feel, and working with them to achieve compassionate relationship-centred care that has meaning for both those who give and receive care, is integral to providing compassionate care.</li>
<li>Developing relationships with self, patients and families, colleagues and the wider organisation are essential to achieve the quality ambitions at the forefront of policy, and professional and practice-related aspirations about compassion.</li>
