<h2>Encouraging healthcare professionals to practice self-compassion</h2>
<p>It is clear from the literature that delivering compassionate care is a complex process which involves understanding the experience of giving and receiving care.</p>
<ul>
<li>Practitioners need space and support to reflect on self in the care-giving experience.</li>
<li>Healthcare professionals need to learn to notice their thoughts and feelings as they arise and develop the ability to tolerate, rather than avoid, difficult feelings, memories or situations.</li>
<li>An awareness of healthcare professionals&rsquo; own emotions, and acting in a way that feels compassionate to both the caregiver and the patient, requires a level of emotional attunement (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Buchanan-Barker P, Barker P (2004) Compassion: more than a feeling. <i>Nursing Standard</i>. 19, 11, 18-19.">Buchanan-Barker and Barker 2004</span>, <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Finfgeld-Connett D (2008) Meta-synthesis of caring in nursing. <i>Journal of Clinical Nursing</i>. 17, 2, 196-204.">Finfgeld-Connett 2008</span>).</li>
<li>Staff need to be supported emotionally if they are to feel safe to engage in meaningful conversations necessary for compassionate care (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Youngson R (2008) <i>Compassion in Healthcare: The Missing Dimension of Healthcare Reform?</i> NHS Confederation, London.http://www.nhsconfed.org/Publications/Documents/compassion_healthcare_future08.pdf">Youngson 2008</span>, <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Dewar B, Mackay R, Smith S, Pullin S, Tocher R (2010) Use of emotional touchpoints as a method of tapping into the experience of receiving compassionate care in a hospital setting. <i>Journal of Research in Nursing</i>. 15, 1, 29-41.http://www.knowledge.scot.nhs.uk/media/CLT/ResourceUploads/1003540/JRN%20Emotional%20touchpoint%20article%20Dec09.pdf">Dewar <i>et al</i> 2010</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other literature highlights the compassion fatigue and emotional burden that can affect the caregiver (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Kooker BM, Shoultz J, Codier EE (2007) Identifying emotional intelligence in professional nursing practice. <i>Journal of Professional Nursing</i>. 23, 1, 30-36.">Kooker <i>et al</i> 2007</span>). While this may be the case, it is important to acknowledge that giving compassionate care can be a significant source of pleasure for caregivers and can be beneficial to individuals&rsquo; mental wellbeing. This is supported by authors who argue that caring is not an emotional burden, but a privilege that practitioners enjoy and that contributes to job satisfaction (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Graber DR, Mitcham MD (2004) Compassionate clinicians: take patient care beyond the ordinary. <i>Holistic Nursing Practice</i>. 18, 2, 87-94.">Graber and Mitcham 2004</span>, <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Pearson A (2006) Powerful caring. <i>Nursing Standard</i>. 20, 48, 20-22.">Pearson 2006</span>, <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Kim S, Flaskerud JH (2007) Cultivating compassion across cultures. <i>Issues in Mental Health Nursing</i>. 28, 8, 931-934.">Kim and Flaskerud 2007</span>, <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Youngson R (2008) <i>Compassion in Healthcare: The Missing Dimension of Healthcare Reform?</i> NHS Confederation, London.http://www.nhsconfed.org/Publications/Documents/compassion_healthcare_future08.pdf">Youngson 2008</span>). <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Graber DR, Mitcham MD (2004) Compassionate clinicians: take patient care beyond the ordinary. <i>Holistic Nursing Practice</i>. 18, 2, 87-94.">Graber and Mitcham (2004)</span> discussed how, in their study, clinicians felt that the expression of compassion sustained and supported them rather than tiring or weakening them.</p>

<h2>Being compassionate with patients and their families</h2>
<p>Developing relationships, emotional connections, interpersonal skills and knowing the person with the illness have been identified as key processes that enable compassion to be realised in practice. Key dimensions of the experience of good care as perceived by patients include (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Chochinov HM, Hack T, McClement S, Kristjanson L, Harlos M (2002) Dignity in the terminally ill: a developing empirical model. <i>Social Science &amp; Medicine</i>. 54, 3, 433-443.">Chochinov <i>et al</i> 2002</span>, <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Walsh K, Kowanko I (2002) Nurses&rsquo; and patients&rsquo; perceptions of dignity. <i>International Journal of Nursing Practice</i>. 8, 3, 143-151.">Walsh and Kowanko 2002</span>, <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Matiti MR, Trorey GM (2008) Patients&rsquo; expectations of the maintenance of their dignity. <i>Journal of Clinical Nursing</i>. 17, 20, 2709-2717.">Matiti and Trorey 2008</span>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Being able to express emotions such as suffering and vulnerability.</li>
<li>Being valued and having individual needs recognised.</li>
<li>Being given choice and opportunities to be involved in care and decision making.</li>
<li>Being respected.</li>
<li>Being cared for by kind, warm and genuine staff.</li>
<li>Being given time by healthcare professionals.</li>
<li>Being given information by staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although dimensions of caring that are valued by patients have been identified, studies have yet to clarify the process involved in delivering compassionate care. Central to the dimensions described above is the process of knowing the person. However, <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Dewing J (2004) Concerns relating to the application of frameworks to promote person-centredness in nursing with older people. <i>Journal of Clinical Nursing</i>. 13, 3a, 39-44.">Dewing (2004)</span> suggested that while person-centred and relationship models for caring emphasise the importance of knowing the person, this is skilled work that demands expertise. It is less clear from the literature what these skills comprise.</p>
<p><b>Interpersonal processes</b></p>
<div class="row">

<p>&lsquo;One of the patients on the ward had been in for a few days after having developed increased confusion. The woman was blind and was being cared for in a single room as it was suspected that she had an infection. She appeared distressed most of the time and called out for people. We were concerned about her distress. I went into her room and asked her how she was feeling &ndash; she called out and her face grimaced. I asked her if there was something that would help us to care for her and she said &ldquo;John 14&rdquo;. I went into her room and asked her how she was feeling &ndash; she called out and her face grimaced. I asked her if there was something that would help us to care for her and she said &ldquo;John 14&rdquo;. She wanted to be read an excerpt from the Bible. I felt nervous about doing this as I was not religious and wondered if I would do this in a way that was appropriate for her. I told the woman how I felt and suggested that I asked the chaplain to come to do this with her. She said no she wanted me to read the Bible to her. She had given me the courage to give it a go.</p>

<p>I realised there were no longer any Bibles in the lockers. They had been removed some time ago because of equality and diversity issues, and infection control. Other staff tried to locate a Bible on neighbouring wards and found no one had one. They finally went to the chaplaincy centre and managed to retrieve one from a large storage cupboard full of Bibles. Reading the Bible had a direct effect on the patient&rsquo;s wellbeing, as was evident in the fact that she became calm and less agitated.</p>

<p>Following discussions with the chaplain, copies of the Bible and Koran were reinstated in all wards in the hospital. It would have been easy for staff to fall at the first hurdle with this example, but they persevered. Staff did worry that they would not always be able to provide the aspects that patients felt were important to them, making them feel that asking the question in the first instance involved taking a risk. It could feel safer not to ask.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">(Dewar 2011)</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<p>Asking questions aimed at finding out what matters to people and how they feel about their experience is not always easy and staff need support to do this. In the case study example in <span class="cite1003 greenText citeText" onclick="gotoCite(this,'to')" id="cite1003">Box 2</span>, the nurse asked how the patient felt and shared with the patient how she felt. Sharing emotion in the nurse-patient interaction can be viewed as unprofessional. <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Stickley T, Freshwater D (2002) The art of loving and the therapeutic relationship. <i>Nursing Inquiry</i>. 9, 4, 250-256.">Stickley and Freshwater (2002)</span> referred to &lsquo;rehabilitating&rsquo; the emotions deemed to be inappropriate back into the nurse-patient relationship, so that healthcare professionals change from adopting a model of keeping one&rsquo;s distance to one of meaningful engagement. It is this meaningful engagement that supports the delivery of compassionate care.</p>
<p>Through expressing emotions, the patient and staff member in the case study example exposed mutual vulnerability. Findings from <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Dewar B, Nolan M (2013) <i>Caring About Caring: Developing A Model to Implement Compassionate Relationship Centred Care in an Older People Care Setting</i>. tinyurl.com/crqsprm (Last accessed: April 8 2012.)">Dewar and Nolan&rsquo;s (2013)</span> study demonstrated that sharing how people &ndash; patients, relatives or staff &ndash; feel about their experience, helped others understand the person and themselves in the context of health care.</p>

<p>It is through engaging with people in this way that practitioners can find out what matters to them and understand how they feel. This, in turn, can help healthcare professionals to work with people in a way that minimises vulnerability. <span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Dewar B, Nolan M (2013) <i>Caring About Caring: Developing A Model to Implement Compassionate Relationship Centred Care in an Older People Care Setting</i>. tinyurl.com/crqsprm (Last accessed: April 8 2012.)">Dewar and Nolan&rsquo;s (2013)</span> study demonstrated that even the most transient of contacts can reflect supportive connection between those involved.
