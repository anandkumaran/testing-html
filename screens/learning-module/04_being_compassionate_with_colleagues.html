<p>Literature tends to prioritise the needs of patients in relation to caring. However, there also needs to be a focus on healthcare professionals.

It is also important to consider whether the interpersonal processes suggested by the empirical work focusing on patient perspectives are similar to those that would help to support staff to receive compassion from their colleagues.</p>
<p>Examples of behaviours and actions that illustrate caring for each other as a team include (<span class="greenText" id="typeText" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" data-info="Dewar B (2011) <i>Caring about Caring: An Appreciative Inquiry about Compassionate Relationship Centred Care</i>. tinyurl.com/cm5w2cz (Last accessed: April 8 2013.)">Dewar 2011</span>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Going out of your way to remember the names of new members of staff rather than using terms such as &lsquo;the student&rsquo; or &lsquo;the bank staff&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Giving positive, specific feedback to others such as &lsquo;I feel really safe and calm when you are in charge of the ward&rsquo;, &lsquo;I value the little things that you do for patients such as bringing shower gel in for the man who had none and had no relatives to do this for him&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Noticing when others are not feeling at their best and working together with them to support them.</li>
<li>Helping people to come to their own understanding about how to deal with a situation rather than just telling them what to do.</li>
<li>Considering other perspectives rather than just thinking what you believe in is right.</li>
<li>Feeling brave enough to challenge behaviour that focuses on negativity and bickering.</li>

<p>Much of what is illustrated in the behaviours and actions above focuses on the way in which people communicate with each other in the team.

<p>The way in which practitioners communicate with each other, and patients and families is fundamental to compassionate care. This has implications for how professionals teach these relational skills, which include asking curious questions, listening, responding together, negotiating and celebrating.</p>

Instead, models should focus on a process of inquiry that demonstrates an appreciation of people&rsquo;s connectedness and emphasises being with people rather than doing things for them.
